const e="Michael Chen, J.D.",o=`The Department of Labor has issued comprehensive regulations addressing the rights of remote workers. These guidelines establish minimum standards for home office stipends, working hours monitoring, and geographic compensation adjustments.

## Key Provisions

### Home Office Requirements
Employers with more than 50 employees must provide a minimum $500 annual stipend for home office maintenance and equipment for employees who work remotely at least 60% of the time.

### Right to Disconnect
Particularly notable is the "right to disconnect" provision, which prohibits employers from requiring responses outside contracted hours except in defined emergency situations. Companies must establish clear communication guidelines that respect employees' right to disconnect.

### Geographic Pay Adjustment
The regulations also address the controversial practice of geographic pay adjustments for remote workers, requiring transparency in calculation methods and prohibiting reductions exceeding 15% of comparable in-office compensation.

## Implementation Timeline

- **June 2025**: Employers must issue updated remote work policies
- **July 2025**: Home office stipend programs must be in place
- **August 2025**: Right to disconnect policies must be implemented

Employers should review existing policies and begin the compliance process to avoid potential class action lawsuits and regulatory penalties.`,t="2025-04-28",n="remote-work-regulations",i="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1600880292203-757bb62b4baf?q=80&w=1470&auto=format&fit=crop",s="Federal",r="New federal guidelines on remote work policies, employee rights, and employer responsibilities.",a=["Employment Law","Labor Regulations","Remote Work"],m="Employment Law Update: Remote Work Regulations",c={author:e,content:o,date:t,id:n,image:i,jurisdiction:s,summary:r,tags:a,title:m};export{e as author,o as content,t as date,c as default,n as id,i as image,s as jurisdiction,r as summary,a as tags,m as title};
