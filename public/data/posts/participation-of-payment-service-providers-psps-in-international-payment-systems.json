  "content": "The International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) has issued a circular (June 06, 2025) outlining the regulatory framework for Payment Service Providers (PSPs) operating within IFSCs to participate in international payment systems. Grounded in the powers conferred under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 and the IFSCA Act, 2019, this directive aims to streamline cross-border payment flows while ensuring robust oversight and compliance.\n\nKey provisions mandate prior approval from IFSCA for PSPs seeking membership in international payment systems, with explicit conditions for systems affecting domestic IFSC transactions. PSPs are required to review and disclose their existing international payment system engagements within 30 days, underscoring the Authority’s focus on transparency and accountability.\n\nThis circular marks a significant step in integrating India’s IFSC ecosystem with global payment networks, fostering efficiency and trust. Stakeholders must act swiftly to align with these requirements, which balance innovation with regulatory safeguards.\n\nThis note below provides a brief summary and analysis of the said Circular.\n\n",
