  "content": "The Department of Labor has issued comprehensive regulations addressing the rights of remote workers. These guidelines establish minimum standards for home office stipends, working hours monitoring, and geographic compensation adjustments.\n\n## Key Provisions\n\n### Home Office Requirements\nEmployers with more than 50 employees must provide a minimum $500 annual stipend for home office maintenance and equipment for employees who work remotely at least 60% of the time.\n\n### Right to Disconnect\nParticularly notable is the \"right to disconnect\" provision, which prohibits employers from requiring responses outside contracted hours except in defined emergency situations. Companies must establish clear communication guidelines that respect employees' right to disconnect.\n\n### Geographic Pay Adjustment\nThe regulations also address the controversial practice of geographic pay adjustments for remote workers, requiring transparency in calculation methods and prohibiting reductions exceeding 15% of comparable in-office compensation.\n\n## Implementation Timeline\n\n- **June 2025**: Employers must issue updated remote work policies\n- **July 2025**: Home office stipend programs must be in place\n- **August 2025**: Right to disconnect policies must be implemented\n\nEmployers should review existing policies and begin the compliance process to avoid potential class action lawsuits and regulatory penalties.",
